The ROS node or nodes to be debugged must be placed in a ROS launch file with the extension .xml or .py . Automatic creation of a launch.json with ROS Launch support .vscode/launch.json is a file which defines a debug launch configuration within VS Code. To create a .vscode/launch.json with ROS debugging support C++ or Python file is selected, vscode uses the selected file to seed the launch creation UI. Click the Run and Debug tab on the left sidebar Select the link to create a .vscode/launch.json file. VS Code will drop down from the command pallet with a list of options, which includes 'ROS'. Select this option. In the next dialog, type the name of the ROS package containing a launch file you'd like to debug. Then find the launch file. Once this is created, you can use the play button in the title bar, or the \"start debugging\" accelerator key, or from the command palle (CTRL-SHIFT-P), select Debug: Start Debugging . NOTE: Other VS Code extensions may interfere with the selection list. If you do not see ROS in the first drop down list, you'll need to create a new file called .vscode/launch.json , then use the manual option described below. Other Notes: * Create a new ROS launch file with just the nodes you'd like to debug, and a separate ROS launch file with all other ROS nodes. * Debugging a launch file with Gazebo or rviz is not supported as this time. Please split these out into separate launch files. * ros2 run is not supported. * Traditional XML launch files are supported for ROS1, and both python and XML based launch files are supported for ROS2. Manually adding a launch file to an existing launch.json If you have an existing launch.json file (or if there is an extension conflict as mentioned above), you can manually add a launch configuration by adding a new block like this. { \"version\" : \"0.2.0\" , \"configurations\" : [ { \"name\" : \"RDE: Launch my file\" , \"request\" : \"launch\" , \"target\" : \"<full path to your launch.py or launch file>\" , \"launch\" : [ \"rviz\" , \"gz\" , \"gzserver\" , \"gzclient\" ], \"type\" : \"RDE\" } ] } Be sure to include the full path to your launch file, including file extension.","title":"Launchdebugging"},{"location":"launchdebugging.html#launch-debugging","text":"","title":"Launch Debugging"},{"location":"launchdebugging.html#launch-debugging_1","text":"The Visual Studio Code extension for ROS supports launch debugging for ROS 2 nodes, written in Python and C++.
